Hereâ€™s a sample README text you can use to describe your small project that demonstrates how to use **Spring Profiles** (with three profiles: `dev`, `preprod`, and `prod` environments) in a Java application:

# Spring Profiles Example - Dev, Preprod, Prod Environments

This project is a simple demonstration of how to use **Spring Profiles** in a Java application to manage different configurations for `dev`, `preprod`, and `prod` environments. Spring Profiles allow you to configure application-specific beans and properties for each environment, ensuring that your application behaves correctly in various stages of development and deployment.

## Features

- **Multiple Profiles:** This project supports three profiles:
  - `dev` - for local development
  - `preprod` - for pre-production testing
  - `prod` - for production deployment
- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Each profile has its own set of environment-specific configurations (such as database connections, API endpoints, or log levels).
- **Easy Switching Between Profiles:** You can easily switch between profiles by setting the active profile in the application configuration or through command-line arguments.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/resources/application.properties** - Contains default configurations.
- **src/main/resources/application-dev.properties** - Contains configurations specific to the `dev` profile.
- **src/main/resources/application-preprod.properties** - Contains configurations specific to the `preprod` profile.
- **src/main/resources/application-prod.properties** - Contains configurations specific to the `prod` profile.

## How to Run the Application

You can run the application with different profiles by setting the `spring.profiles.active` property.

### Running with the Dev Profile
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

### Running with the Preprod Profile
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=preprod
```

### Running with the Prod Profile
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod
```

Alternatively, you can specify the active profile in the `application.properties` file:
```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

## Example Use Cases

1. **Development (`dev`)**:
   - Uses an in-memory H2 database for quick testing and development.
   - Configured with verbose logging for debugging purposes.
   
2. **Preproduction (`preprod`)**:
   - Uses a dedicated pre-production database and services.
   - Configured to closely mimic production settings but without the risk of affecting real users.
   
3. **Production (`prod`)**:
   - Uses the live production database and optimized services.
   - Configured with stricter logging and security measures suitable for production environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3+**
- **Maven**
- **H2 (for dev environment)**
